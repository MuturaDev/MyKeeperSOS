MyKeeperSOS
===========

Overview
--------

Welcome to MyKeeperSOS! This iOS app is designed as a safety tool, built with SwiftUI, to detect falls and provide a quick and easy way to request emergency services or assistance. With features like vibration and notifications upon detecting a fall, a confirmation prompt, and automatic SMS alerts to registered emergency contacts, MyKeeperSOS is developed with a focus on user safety and learning SwiftUI for iOS app development.

Features
--------

### 1\. Fall Detection:

-   The app utilizes sensors to detect a fall, triggering subsequent safety measures.

### 2\. Vibrate and Notification:

-   Vibrates the phone and displays a notification when a fall is detected.

### 3\. Confirmation Prompt:

-   Provides users with a few seconds to confirm if they need emergency services or help.

### 4\. SMS Alert:
